When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to make my project open source and want developers to actively contribute to the code base, using a
remote is the right choice. Even when the project is a propriety one, remote can be used as it facilitates 
contribution from multiple people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?
Sometimes, we may not want the latest versions we may still we working with an old version, in that case it is better 
to have manual control over pull.
